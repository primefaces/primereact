# Introduction

In traditional 3rd party UI libraries, users are limited to the API provided by component author. This API commonly consists of props, events and slots. Whenever a requirement emerges for a new customization option in the API, the component
author needs to develop and publish it with a new release.

Vision of PrimeTek is `Your components, not ours`. The pass through feature is a key element to implement this vision by exposing the component internals in order to apply arbitrary attributes and listeners to the DOM elements. The primary
advantage of this approach is that it frees you from being restricted by the main component API. We recommend considering the pass-through feature whenever you need to tailor a component that lacks a built-in feature for your specific
requirement.

Two videos are available at PrimeTV youtube channel, first one is an introduction and second one covers a unique case that is solved by the pass-through.

# Basic

Each component has a special `pt` property to define an object with keys corresponding to the available DOM elements. Each value can either be a string, an object or a function that returns a string or an object to define the
arbitrary properties to apply to the element such as styling, aria, data-\* or custom attributes. If the value is a string or a function that returns a string, it is considered as a className definition and added to the className attribute of the
element. Every component documentation has a dedicated section to document the available section names exposed via PT.

Most common usage of `pt` is styling and customization. Example below styles an unstyled Panel component with Tailwind CSS library.

<DocComponentViewer name="passthrough:basic-demo" />

## Global

Defines the shared pass through properties per component type. For example, with the configuration below all panel headers have the `bg-primary` style class and the all autocomplete components have a fixed width. These settings can be overriden by a particular component as components `pt` property has higher precedence over global `pt`.

```tsx
pt: {
    panel: {
        header: {
            class: 'bg-primary text-primary-contrast'
        }
    },
    autocomplete: {
        input: {
            root: 'w-64' // OR { class: 'w-64' }
        }
    }
}
```

## Custom CSS

The `global` property has a `css` option to define custom css that belongs to a global `pt` configuration. Common use case of this feature is defining global styles and animations related to the pass through configuration.

```tsx
pt: {
    global: {
        css: \`
            .my-button {
                border-width: 2px;
            }
        \`
    },
    button: {
        root: 'my-button'
    }
}
```

## UsePassThrough

An existing pass through configuration is customized with the `usePassThrough` utility. The first parameter is the object to customize, the second parameter is the customizations and the final parameter is the merge strategy.

```tsx
import { usePassThrough } from '@primereact/core/passthrough';
import BasePreset from './basepreset';

const CustomPreset = usePassThrough(
    BasePreset,
    {
        panel: {
            title: {
                class: ['leading-none font-light text-2xl']
            }
        }
    },
    {
        mergeSections: true,
        mergeProps: false
    }
);
```

The `mergeSections` defines whether the sections from the main configuration gets added and the `mergeProps` controls whether to override or merge the defined props. Defaults are `true` for `mergeSections` and `false` for `mergeProps`.

```tsx
const CustomPreset = usePassThrough(
    BasePreset,
    {
        panel: {
            header: 'my_panel_header'
        }
    },
    { mergeSections: true, mergeProps: false }
);

// Output:
// panel.header.class => 'my_panel_header'
// panel.title.class => Tailwind.panel.title.class
```

```tsx
const CustomPreset = usePassThrough(
    BasePreset,
    {
        panel: {
            header: 'my_panel_header'
        }
    },
    { mergeSections: true, mergeProps: true }
);

// Output:
// panel.header.class => [Tailwind.panel.header.class, 'my_panel_header']
// panel.title.class => Tailwind.panel.title.class
```

```tsx
const CustomPreset = usePassThrough(
    BasePreset,
    {
        panel: {
            header: 'my_panel_header'
        }
    },
    { mergeSections: false, mergeProps: true }
);

// Output:
// panel.header.class => [Tailwind.panel.header.class, 'my_panel_header']
// panel.title.class => undefined
```

```tsx
const CustomPreset = usePassThrough(
    BasePreset,
    {
        panel: {
            header: 'my_panel_header'
        }
    },
    { mergeSections: false, mergeProps: false }
);

// Output:
// panel.header.class => 'my_panel_header'
// panel.title.class => undefined
```
