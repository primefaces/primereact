## Usage

```tsx
import { Stepper } from 'primereact/stepper';
```

```tsx
<Stepper>
    <Stepper.List>
        <Stepper.Step>
            <Stepper.Header />
            <Stepper.Separator />
        </Stepper.Step>
    <Stepper.Panels>
        <Stepper.Panel />
    </Stepper.Panels>
</Stepper>
```

## Examples

### Horizontal

Stepper requires two `Stepper.List`, `Stepper.Step`, `Stepper.Panels` and `Stepper.Panel` components as children which are displayed horizontally.

<DocComponentViewer name="stepper:horizontal-demo" />

### Vertical

Stepper requires two `Stepper.Item`, `Stepper.Step` and `Stepper.Panel` components as children which are displayed vertically.

<DocComponentViewer name="stepper:vertical-demo" />

### Linear

Linear mode enforces step-by-step progression through the workflow, requiring users to complete the current step before proceeding to the next one. This ensures a controlled navigation flow through the process.

<DocComponentViewer name="stepper:linear-demo" />

### Steps Only

When you need a more compact UI, the steps-only mode displays just the step indicators without content panels. This is useful for indicating progress without showing the actual step content.

<DocComponentViewer name="stepper:steps-only-demo" />

### Template

The optional `as` property controls the default container element of a step, for example setting it to a button renders a button for the header instead of a div. The `asChild` option enables the headless mode for further customization by passing callbacks and properties to implement your own step.

<DocComponentViewer name="stepper:template-demo" />

## Accessibility

### Screen Reader

Stepper container is defined with the `tablist` role, as any attribute is passed to the container element `aria-labelledby` can be optionally used to specify an element to describe the Stepper. Each stepper header has a `tab` role and `aria-controls` to refer to the corresponding stepper content element. The content element of each stepper has `tabpanel` role, an id to match the `aria-controls` of the header and `aria-labelledby` reference to the header as the accessible name.

### Tab Header Keyboard Support

| Key   | Function                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- |
| tab   | Moves focus through the header.       |
| enter | Activates the focused stepper header. |
| space | Activates the focused stepper header. |
