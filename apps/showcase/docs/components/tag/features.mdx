## Usage

```tsx
import { Tag } from 'primereact/tag';
```

```tsx
<Tag></Tag>
```

## Examples

### Basic

`Tag.Label` is used to define the label of the tag.

<DocComponentViewer name="tag:basic-demo" />

### Icon

Use `Tag.Icon` to display an icon next to the label. Place the icon left or right of the label.

<DocComponentViewer name="tag:icon-demo" />

### Severity

Use `severity` property to define the severity of the tag.

<DocComponentViewer name="tag:severity-demo" />

### Pill

Use `rounded` property to display a tag as a pill.

<DocComponentViewer name="tag:pill-demo" />

### Template

Children of the component are passed as the content for templating.

<DocComponentViewer name="tag:template-demo" />

### As button

Use `as="button"` to display a tag as a button.

<DocComponentViewer name="tag:button-demo" />

## Accessibility

### Screen Reader

Tag does not include any roles and attributes by default, any attribute is passed to the root element so aria roles and attributes can be added if required. If the tags are dynamic, aria-live may be utilized as well. In case badges need to be tabbable, tabindex can be added to implement custom key handlers.

### Keyboard Support

Component does not include any interactive elements.
