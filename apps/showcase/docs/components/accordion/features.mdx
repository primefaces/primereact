## Examples

### Basic

Accordion is defined using `Accordion`, `Accordion.Panel`, `Accordion.Header`, `Accordion.HeaderIndicator` and `Accordion.Content` components. Each `Accordion.Panel` must contain a unique `value` property to specify the active item.

<DocComponentViewer name="accordion:basic-demo" />

### Multiple

Only one tab at a time can be active by default, enabling `multiple` property changes this behavior to allow multiple panels. In this case `multiple` needs to be an array.

<DocComponentViewer name="accordion:multiple-demo" />

### Custom Indicator

The `Accordion.HeaderIndicator` component is used to display the indicator of the header. It can be customized by passing a function that returns a React element or `data-p-active` attribute.

<DocComponentViewer name="accordion:custom-indicator-demo" />

### Disabled

Enabling `disabled` property of an `Accordion.Panel` prevents user interaction of the panel or enable `disabled` of the `Accordion` component disables all panels.

<DocComponentViewer name="accordion:disabled-demo" />

### Template

The optional `as` property controls the default container element of a header, for example setting it to a div renders a div for the header instead of a button. The `asChild` option enables the headless mode for further customization by passing callbacks and properties to implement your own header.

<DocComponentViewer name="accordion:template-demo" />

### With RadioButton

`RadioButton` component can be used to group multiple `Accordion.Panel` components.

<DocComponentViewer name="accordion:use-with-radiobutton" />

## Accessibility

### Screen Reader

Accordion header elements is a button element and use aria-controls to define the id of the content section along with aria-expanded for the visibility state. The value to read a header element defaults to the value of the header property and can be customized by defining an aria-label or aria-labelledby via the pt property.

The content uses region role, defines an id that matches the aria-controls of the header and aria-labelledby referring to the id of the header.

### Header Keyboard Support

| Key           | Function                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tab`         | Moves focus to the next focusable element in the page tab sequence.                                  |
| `shift + tab` | Moves focus to the previous focusable element in the page tab sequence.                              |
| `enter`       | Toggles the visibility of the content.                                                               |
| `space`       | Toggles the visibility of the content.                                                               |
| `down arrow`  | Moves focus to the next header. If focus is on the last header, moves focus to the first header.     |
| `up arrow`    | Moves focus to the previous header. If focus is on the first header, moves focus to the last header. |
| `home`        | Moves focus to the first header.                                                                     |
| `end`         | Moves focus to the last header.                                                                      |
