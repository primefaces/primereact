## Examples

### Basic

Drawer is defined using `Drawer`, `Drawer.Trigger`, `Drawer.Portal`, `Drawer.Header`, `Drawer.Content`, and `Drawer.Footer` components.

<DocDemoViewer name="drawer:basic-demo" />

### Position

The position of the drawer can be customized with the `position` property. The available values are `left`, `right`, `top` and `bottom`.

<DocDemoViewer name="drawer:position-demo" />

### Full Screen

The full screen mode is enabled when position property is set as `full`.

<DocDemoViewer name="drawer:full-screen-demo" />

## Accessibility

### Screen Reader

Drawer component uses `complementary` role by default, since any attribute is passed to the root element aria role can be changed depending on your use case and additional attributes like `aria-labelledby` can be added. In addition `aria-modal` is added since focus is kept within the drawer when opened.

Trigger element also has aria-expanded and aria-controls to be handled explicitly.
