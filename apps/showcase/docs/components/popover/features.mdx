### Screen Reader

Popover component uses dialog role and since any attribute is passed to the root element you may define attributes like aria-label or aria-labelledby to describe the popup contents. In addition aria-modal is added since focus is kept within the popup.

Popover adds aria-expanded state attribute and aria-controls to the trigger so that the relation between the trigger and the popup is defined.

### Popover Keyboard Support

When the popup gets opened, the first focusable element receives the focus and this can be customized by adding autofocus to an element within the popup.

| Key           | Function                                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tab`         | Moves focus to the next the focusable element within the popup.     |
| `shift + tab` | Moves focus to the previous the focusable element within the popup. |
| `escape`      | Closes the popup and moves focus to the trigger.                    |
