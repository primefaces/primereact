title: Fluid
description: Fluid is a layout component to make descendant components span full width of their container.
component: fluid
---

## Usage

```tsx
import { Fluid } from 'primereact/fluid';
```

```tsx
<Fluid></Fluid>
```

## Examples

### Basic

Components with the _fluid_ option like _InputText_ have the ability to span the full width of their component. Enabling the _fluid_ for each component individually may be cumbersome so wrap the content with _Fluid_ to instead for an easier alternative.

Any component that has the _fluid_ property can be nested inside the _Fluid_ component. The fluid property of a child component has higher precedence than the _fluid_ container as shown in the last sample.
