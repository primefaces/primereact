## Accessibility

### Screen Reader

Rating component internally uses radio buttons that are only visible to screen readers. The value to read for item is retrieved from the [locale](/docs/configuration#locale) API via `star` and `stars` of the `aria` property.

### Keyboard Support

Keyboard interaction is derived from the native browser handling of radio buttons in a group.
