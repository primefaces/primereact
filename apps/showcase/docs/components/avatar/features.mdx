## Accessibility

### Screen Reader

Avatar does not include any roles and attributes by default. Any attribute is passed to the root element so you may add a role like img along with aria-labelledby or aria-label to describe the component. In case avatars need to be tabbable, tabindex can be added as well to implement custom key handlers.

### Keyboard Support 

Component does not include any interactive elements.
