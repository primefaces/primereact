## Usage

```tsx
import { Listbox } from 'primereact/listbox';
```

```tsx
<Listbox>
    <Listbox.Options />
</Listbox>
```

## Examples

### Basic

Listbox is used as a controlled component with `value` and `onValueChange` properties along with an `options` collection. Label and value of an option are defined with the `optionLabel` and `optionValue` properties respectively.
Note that, when options are simple primitive values such as a string array, no `optionLabel` and `optionValue` would be necessary.

### Option

Options can be defined manually using `Listbox.Option` component for custom rendering. Each option requires a `uKey` or `index` prop for identification. The `optionKey` property on the Listbox specifies which field from the data corresponds to the option keys.

<DocDemoViewer name="listbox:option-demo" />

### Selection

Listbox provides various selection modes. By default, only single item can be selected.

#### Checkmark

A checkmark icon is displayed next to the selected option when `checkmark` property is enabled.

<DocDemoViewer name="listbox:checkmark-selection-demo" />

#### Multiple

Multiple items can be selected by setting `multiple` property. In this mode, the value binding should be an array.

<DocDemoViewer name="listbox:multiple-selection-demo" />

#### Checkbox

Checkboxes can be displayed alongside each option by enabling the `checkbox` property. This works with `multiple` selection mode to provide a familiar multi-select UI. You can also add a `Listbox.Header` to display a title or additional controls.

<DocDemoViewer name="listbox:checkbox-selection-demo" />

#### Custom

For full control over the option rendering and selection display, a custom render function can be used inside `Listbox.Options`. The function receives the listbox instance and options data, allowing completely custom option layouts with dynamic selection indicators.

<DocDemoViewer name="listbox:custom-selection-demo" />

### Group

Options can be organized into groups with headers. Use `optionGroupLabel` to specify the label field for groups and `optionGroupChildren` to define the field that contains the items in each group.

<DocDemoViewer name="listbox:group-demo" />

### Filter

Filtering enables searching through the options. Place a `Listbox.Filter` component inside `Listbox.Header` to add a search input. Any input component can be used with the `as` prop and the filtering logic can be controlled with the `onChange` event.

<DocDemoViewer name="listbox:filter-demo" />

### Invalid

When the `invalid` property is set to true, a visual hint is applied to indicate that the Listbox is in an invalid state. This is commonly used for form validation feedback.

<DocDemoViewer name="listbox:invalid-demo" />

### Disabled

When the `disabled` property is set to true, the Listbox becomes non-interactive and a visual hint is applied to indicate that it cannot be used.

<DocDemoViewer name="listbox:disabled-demo" />

## Accessibility

### Screen Reader

Value to describe the component can be provided `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label` props. The list element has a listbox role with the aria-multiselectable attribute that sets to true when multiple selection is enabled. Each list item has an option role with `aria-selected` and `aria-disabled` as their attributes.
