## Usage

```tsx
import { Switch } from 'primereact/switch';

```tsx

    <Switch.Control>
        <Switch.Thumb />
    </Switch.Control>
</Switch>
```

## Examples

### Basic

Switch demonstrates the standard implementation with checkbox functionality. It provides a simple on/off toggle that responds to user interaction with animated visual feedback.

<DocComponentViewer name="switch:basic-demo" />

### Controlled

A controlled Switch requires managing the checked state with a state variable and handling the change event manually. This allows for complete control over the Switch's behavior.

<DocComponentViewer name="switch:controlled-demo" />

### Uncontrolled

For an uncontrolled Switch component, `defaultChecked` is used to set the initial state, and the component manages its own state internally.

<DocComponentViewer name="switch:uncontrolled-demo" />

### Template

`Switch.Thumb` also allows displaying custom content inside itself.

<DocComponentViewer name="switch:template-demo" />

### Customization

`Switch` component supports customization through CSS classes. The appearance, including colors and other visual properties, can be modified by applying custom classes to the component.

<DocComponentViewer name="switch:customization-demo" />

### Invalid

Invalid state is displayed using the `invalid` prop to indicate a failed validation. You can use this style when integrating with form validation libraries.

<DocComponentViewer name="switch:invalid-demo" />

### Disabled

When `disabled` is present, the element cannot be edited and focused.

<DocComponentViewer name="switch:disabled-demo" />

## Accessibility

### Screen Reader

Switch component uses a hidden native checkbox element with switch role internally that is only visible to screen readers. Value to describe the component can either be provided via `label` tag combined with `id` prop or using `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label` props.

```tsx
<label htmlFor="switch1">Remember Me</label>
<Switch inputId="switch1" />

<span id="switch2">Remember Me</span>
<Switch aria-labelledby="switch2" />

<Switch aria-label="Remember Me" />
```

### Keyboard Support

| Key   | Function                   |
| ----- | -------------------------- |
| tab   | Moves focus to the switch. |
| space | Toggles the checked state. |
