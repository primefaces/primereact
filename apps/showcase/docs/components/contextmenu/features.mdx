## Examples

### Basic

The main `Menu` component groups menu items with `Menu.List`, adds individual menu elements with `Menu.Item`, uses separators with `Menu.Separator`, and creates submenus with `Menu.Sub`. Submenus are triggered by `Menu.Trigger` and can have their own `Menu.List` structure.

## Accessibility

### Screen Reader

Menu component uses the `menu` role and the value to describe the menu can either be provided with `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label` props. Each list item has a `menuitem` role with `aria-label` referring to the
label of the item and `aria-disabled` defined if the item is disabled.

In popup mode, the component implicitly manages the `aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup` and `aria-controls` attributes of the target element to define the relation between the target and the popup.
