## Import

```tsx
import { Panel } from 'primereact/panel';
```

## Basic

Panel is a container component with a _Panel.Header_ and _Panel.Content_.

<DocDemoViewer name="panel:basic-demo" />

## Toggleable

When the _toggleable_ property is enabled, content can be expanded and collapsed using the _Panel.Header_ interaction.

<DocDemoViewer name="panel:toggleable-demo" />

## Controlled

A controlled Panel requires managing the collapsed state with a state variable and handling the toggle event manually. This allows for complete control over the Panel's behavior.

<DocDemoViewer name="panel:controlled-demo" />

## Uncontrolled

An uncontrolled Panel manages its own collapsed state internally. You can simply use the `toggleable` property without controlling the collapsed state, letting the component handle all toggle behavior automatically.

<DocDemoViewer name="panel:uncontrolled-demo" />

## Template

Header and footer sections of the panel can be customized using _Panel.Header_ and _Panel.Footer_ components.

<DocDemoViewer name="panel:template-demo" />

## Accessibility

### Screen Reader

Toggleable panels use a content toggle button at the header that has _aria-controls_ to define the id of the content section along with _aria-expanded_ for the visibility state. The value to read the button defaults to the value can be customized by defining an _aria-label_ or _aria-labelledby_ property.
