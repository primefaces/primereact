## Import

```tsx
import { Panel } from 'primereact/panel';
```

## Basic

Panel is a container component with a _Panel.Header_ and _Panel.Content_.

<DocDemoViewer name="panel:basic-demo" />

## Toggleable

Panel can be made toggleable by using the _Motion_ component or an animation library to animate the visibility of the content.
The _Panel.Header_ contains a button to toggle the visibility of the content, and the _Panel.Content_ is wrapped inside the _Motion_ component to handle the animation.

<DocDemoViewer name="panel:toggleable-demo" />

## Template

Header and footer sections of the panel can be customized using _Panel.Header_ and _Panel.Footer_ components.

<DocDemoViewer name="panel:template-demo" />

## Accessibility

### Screen Reader

Toggleable panels use a content toggle button at the header that has _aria-controls_ to define the id of the content section along with _aria-expanded_ for the visibility state. The value to read the button defaults to the value can be customized by defining an _aria-label_ or _aria-labelledby_ property.
