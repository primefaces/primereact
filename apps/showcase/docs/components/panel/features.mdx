When the _toggleable_ property is enabled, content can be expanded and collapsed using the _Panel.Header_ interaction.

## Accessibility

### Screen Reader

Toggleable panels use a content toggle button at the header that has _aria-controls_ to define the id of the content section along with _aria-expanded_ for the visibility state.

The content uses _region_, defines an id that matches the _aria-controls_ of the content toggle button and _aria-labelledby_ referring to the id of the header.
