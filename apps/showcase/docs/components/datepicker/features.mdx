## Accessibility

### Screen Reader

Value to describe the component can either be provided via `label` tag combined with `inputId` prop or using `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label` props. The input element has `combobox` role in addition to
`aria-autocomplete` as "none", `aria-haspopup` as "dialog" and `aria-expanded` attributes. The relation between the input and the popup is created with `aria-controls` attribute that refers to the id of the popup.

The optional datepicker button requires includes `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded` for states along with `aria-controls` to define the relation between the popup and the button. The value to read is retrieved from the
`chooseDate` key of the aria property from the <Link href="/configuration/#locale">locale</Link> API. This label is also used for the `aria-label` of the popup as well. When there is a value selected, it is formatted and
appended to the label to be able to notify users about the current value.

Popup has a `dialog` role along with `aria-modal` and `aria-label`. The navigation buttons at the header has an `aria-label` retrieved from the `prevYear`, `nextYear`, `prevMonth`, `nextMonth`,
`prevDecade` and `nextDecade` keys of the locale aria API. Similarly month picker button uses the `chooseMonth` and year picker button uses the `chooseYear` keys.

Main date table uses `grid` role that contains th elements with `col` as the scope along with `abbr` tag resolving to the full name of the month. Each date cell has an `aria-label` referring to the full date value.
Buttons at the footer utilize their readable labels as `aria-label` as well. Selected date also receives the `aria-selected` attribute.

Timepicker spinner buttons get their labels for `aria-label` from the aria locale API using the `prevHour`, `nextHour`, `prevMinute`, `nextMinute`, `prevSecond`, `nextSecond`, `am` and
`pm` keys.

DatePicker also includes a hidden section that is only available to screen readers with `aria-live` as "polite". This element is updated when the selected date changes to instruct the user about the current date selected.
