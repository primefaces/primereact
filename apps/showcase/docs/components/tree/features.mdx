## Usage

```tsx
import { Tree } from 'primereact/tree';
```

```tsx
<Tree>
    <Tree.List>
        <Tree.Node>
            <Tree.Content>
                <Tree.Toggle />
            </Tree.Content>
        </Tree.Node>
    </Tree.List>
</Tree>
```

## Examples

### Basic

The basic example demonstrates a simple Tree implementation where nodes are expanded and collapsed on click.

<DocDemoViewer name="tree:basic-demo" />

### Node

Tree nodes can be customized with templates using the `Tree.Node` components.

<DocDemoViewer name="tree:node-demo" />

### Controlled

Tree state can be controlled programmatically with the `expandedKeys` property that defines the keys that are expanded. This property is a Map instance whose key is the key of a node and value is a boolean.

<DocDemoViewer name="tree:controlled-demo" />

### Selection

#### Single

Single node selection is configured by setting `selectionMode` as `single` along with `selectionKeys` property to manage the selection value binding.

<DocDemoViewer name="tree:single-selection-demo" />

#### Multiple

More than one node is selectable by setting `selectionMode` to` multiple`. By default in multiple selection mode, metaKey press (e.g. `⌘`) is not necessary to add to existing selections. When the optional `metaKeySelection` is present, behavior is changed in a way that selecting a new node requires meta key to be present. Note that in touch enabled devices, Tree always ignores metaKey.

In multiple selection mode, value binding should be a key-value pair where key is the node key and value is a boolean to indicate selection.

<DocDemoViewer name="tree:multiple-selection-demo" />

#### Checkbox

Selection of multiple nodes via checkboxes is enabled by configuring `selectionMode` as `checkbox`.

In checkbox selection mode, value binding should be a key-value pair where key is the node key and value is an object that has `checked` and `partialChecked` properties to represent the checked state of a node object to indicate selection.

<DocDemoViewer name="tree:checkbox-selection-demo" />

### Lazy Loading

Lazy loading is demonstrated in this example where nodes are loaded on demand when a node is expanded.

<DocDemoViewer name="tree:lazy-demo" />

### Filter

Filtering enables searching through the nodes. Place a `Tree.Filter` component inside `Tree.Header` to add a search input. Any input component can be used with the `as` prop and the filtering logic can be controlled with the `onChange` event.

<DocDemoViewer name="tree:filter-demo" />
