## Introduction

PrimeReact is a popular Vue UI library maintained by PrimeTek, a company renowned for its comprehensive set of UI components for various frameworks. PrimeTek is dedicated to providing high-quality, versatile, and accessible UI components
that help developers build better applications faster.

### Development Setup

To begin with, clone the PrimeReact repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/primefaces/primereact.git
cd primereact
```

Then run the showcase in your local environment at `http://localhost:3000/`.

```bash
pnpm run setup
pnpm run dev
```

### Project Structure

PrimeReact utilizes a monorepo architecture, the libraries are located at `packages` folder and the website is at `apps/showcase`.

```bash
- apps
  - showcase                // website
- packages
  - core                    // core api
  - headless                // headless components
  - hooks                   // hooks for components
  - icons                   // primeicons
  - primereact              // main package of components and directives
  - styles                  // styles for components

Your expertise can help others solve problems and improve their experience with PrimeReact.

## Key Points

PrimeReact has several add-ons such as UI Kit, Premium Templates, and Blocks that rely on design tokens and styling. Any core structural changes, such as adding new props, events, or updating design tokens, should be communicated with the
core team to ensure consistency and compatibility.

## Communication

Join the Contributors channel on the [PrimeLand Discord](https://discord.gg/primefaces) server to connect with PrimeReact staff and fellow contributors. In this channel, you can discuss the areas you want to
contribute to and receive feedback. This channel is open to everyone who'd like to contribute.

## Pathway

PrimeTek offers an organization structure involving contributors and the core team:

### Contributor Role

After a certain period of frequent contributions, a community member is offered the Contributor role. On average, it may take about three months, but the exact duration can vary depending on the individual commitment.

### Committer Role

If a contributor actively participates in the codebase and PRs, their role may be upgraded to a Committer level, providing direct commit access to the PrimeReact codebase.

### Employment

PrimeTek prefers to hire team members from open source committers, so you may be offered a full-time position when a position becomes available.

## Benefits

Contributing to PrimeReact comes with several benefits. Being part of an open-source project will enhance your career and open up exciting opportunities. Contributors and Committers will be listed on our [team page](/docs/team). You'll gain significant visibility in the developer community while improving yourself as a professional.

You'll be invited to a private communication channel at Discord to get in touch with PrimeTek. In addition, contributors have access to all PrimeReact add-ons like Premium Templates, Blocks, and UI Kit free of charge.

## CLA

When a community member is offered the Contributor role, they are expected to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for legal purposes. This helps protect both the contributor and PrimeTek.
