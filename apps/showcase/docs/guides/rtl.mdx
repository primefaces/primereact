title: RTL Support
description: Right-to-left direction support of PrimeReact.
---

## Configuration

The PrimeReact components natively support Right-to-Left (RTL) text direction through a modern CSS implementation utilizing FlexBox and classes like `*-inline-start` and `*-block-end`. Consequently, no JavaScript configuration is necessary; setting the document's text direction to RTL is sufficient to enable this feature.

The RTL setting can either be set using the `dir` attribute or with the `direction` style property.

### With Markup

```html
<html dir="rtl"></html>
```

### With CSS

```css
html {
    direction: rtl;
}
```

## Limitations

RTL is widely supported by the UI suite except the Galleria and Carousel components. These components will be enhanced with a modern implementation in upcoming versions with built-in support for RTL.
