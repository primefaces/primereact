description: Setting up PrimeReact in a Vite project.
---

## Install Packages

Install PrimeReact and a theme package using your favorite package manager:

```bash
# npm
npm install primereact @primeuix/themes
# yarn
yarn add primereact @primeuix/themes
# pnpm
pnpm add primereact @primeuix/themes
```

## Getting Started

### Provider

Wrap your app with `PrimeProvider` in your main file (like `main.jsx` or `App.jsx`). This enables PrimeReact features everywhere in your app:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { PrimeProvider } from '@primereact/core';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <PrimeProvider>
            <App />
        </PrimeProvider>
    </React.StrictMode>
);
```

### Theme

PrimeReact supports many themes. To use the Aura theme, import it and pass it to the provider:

```jsx
import Aura from '@primeuix/themes/aura';
import { PrimeProvider } from '@primereact/core';
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <PrimeProvider theme={Aura}>
            <App />
        </PrimeProvider>
    </React.StrictMode>
);
```

### Verify

To verify that PrimeReact is installed correctly, you can create a simple component such as [Button](/button) and render it in your application.
Each component can be imported and registered individually so that you only include what you use for bundle optimization. Import path is available in the documentation of the corresponding component.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'primereact/button';

export default function VerifyInstallation() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h2>Verify Installation</h2>
            <Button label="Click Me" />
        </div>
    );
}
```

## More Tips

- You can import and use only the components you need for a smaller bundle size.
- For icons, custom themes, and advanced setup, see the [PrimeReact documentation](https://primefaces.org/primereact/setup).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation or setup, check the following:

- Ensure that you have the latest version of Vite and Node.js installed.
- Verify that your project structure is correct and that the `PrimeProvider` is properly wrapped around your application.
- Check the browser console for any errors related to PrimeReact components or themes.
- If you are using TypeScript, ensure that you have the necessary type definitions installed.
- Refer to the [PrimeReact GitHub repository](https://github.com/primefaces/primereact) for more information and support.
