## Import

```tsx
import { Badge } from 'primereact/badge';
```

## Basic

Content to display is defined with the _value_ property or the default slot.

<DocComponentViewer name="badge-basic-demo" filePath="demo/badge/badge-basic-demo.tsx" />

## Severity

Severity defines the variant of a badge.

<DocComponentViewer name="badge-severity-demo" filePath="demo/badge/badge-severity-demo.tsx" />

## Size

Use the _size_ property to customize the dimensions of a Badge.

<DocComponentViewer name="badge-size-demo" filePath="demo/badge/badge-size-demo.tsx" />

## Overlay

A badge can be added to any element by encapsulating the content with the _OverlayBadge_ component.

<DocComponentViewer name="badge-overlay-demo" filePath="demo/badge/badge-overlay-demo.tsx" />

## Button

Buttons have built-in support for badges to display a badge inline.

<DocComponentViewer name="badge-button-demo" filePath="demo/badge/badge-button-demo.tsx" />

## Accessibility

### Screen Reader

Badge does not include any roles and attributes by default, any attribute is passed to the root element so aria roles and attributes can be added if required. If the badges are dynamic, _aria-live_ may be utilized as well. In case badges need to be tabbable, _tabindex_ can be added to implement custom key handlers.

### Keyboard Support

Component does not include any interactive elements.
