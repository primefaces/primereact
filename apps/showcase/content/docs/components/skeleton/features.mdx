## Accessibility

### Screen Reader

Skeleton uses aria-hidden as "true" so that it gets ignored by screen readers, any valid attribute is passed to the root element so you may customize it further if required. If multiple skeletons are grouped inside a container, you may use aria-busy on the container element as well to indicate the loading process.
