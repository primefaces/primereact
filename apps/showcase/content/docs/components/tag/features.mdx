##Â Accessibility

### Screen Reader

Tag does not include any roles and attributes by default, any attribute is passed to the root element so aria roles and attributes can be added if required. If the tags are dynamic, aria-live may be utilized as well. In case badges need to be tabbable, tabindex can be added to implement custom key handlers.

### Keyboard Support

Component does not include any interactive elements.
