## Import

```tsx
import { Inplace } from 'primevue/inplace';
```

## Basic 

_Inplace_ component requires _display_ and _content_ templates to define the content of each state.

<DocComponentViewer name="inplace-basic-demo" filePath="demo/inplace/inplace-basic-demo.tsx"/>

## Input

The __closeCallback__ switches the state back to display mode when called from an event.

<DocComponentViewer name="inplace-input-demo" filePath="demo/inplace/inplace-input-demo.tsx"/>

## Image

Any content such as an image can be placed inside an Inplace.

<DocComponentViewer  name="inplace-image-demo" filePath="demo/inplace/inplace-image-demo.tsx"/>

## Accessibility

### View Mode Keyboard Support

| Key | Function |
