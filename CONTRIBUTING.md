Contributing to PrimeReact: Terms and Conditions
================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you want to contribute your work to PrimeReact? Well, then first and most important: **THANK YOU!** 


Now, in order to accept your contribution, there are some terms you must expressly agree with, so please
read them carefully. They might look a bit cumbersome, but they are here just in order to protect 
you, your contribution, and especially the project's future.

**Important**: submitting any contributions to the PrimeReact project implies your **full acceptance of these terms**,
including the *"PrimeReact Individual Contributor License Agreement"* detailed at the end. 

Who can contribute?
-------------------

Anyone, with the unique condition that he/she must be a **private individual**, acting in 
his/her own name, and not being endorsed in their contributed work by any company or government.

Note that this condition will not only refer to the ownership of the effort invested in contributing 
to the project, but also to the fact that *no private or public company will be mentioned as a a part 
of your contribution on the project's website or code*, including but not limited to web/email addresses 
or package names.


What is the first step to be taken?
-----------------------------------

First of all, **Discuss with the [project members](https://forum.primefaces.org/viewforum.php?f=57)** (a new thread should do) about 
your ideas: new features, fixes, documentation... whatever you would like to contribute to the project. Let we 
discuss the possibilities with you so that we make sure your contribution goes in the right direction and aligns 
with the project's standards, intentions and roadmap. 



How will your relation with the PrimeReact project be?
-----------------------------------------------------

Your contributions will have the form of GitHub *pull requests*. Note that contributors do not 
have read+write (or *pull+push*) access to the project repositories, only project *members* do. 

Also, please understand that *not all pull requests will be accepted and merged into the project's 
repositories*. Talking about your planned contributions with the project members before creating pull requests
will maximize the possibilities of your contributions being accepted.

About the code you contribute
-----------------------------

### General guidelines:
  
  - Obviously, **your code must both compile and work correctly**. Also, the addition of any new patches to the 
    codebase should not render it unstable in any way.
  - All your code should be easy to read and understand by a human.
  - There should be no compilation warnings at all.
  - Checkstyle must pass without errors or warnings. Currently this is embedded into the maven build.

### Detailed code quality standards:
  
  - All your code should compile and run in **Node 16.x or higher**.
  - All comments, names of classes and variables, log messages, etc. must be **in English**.

  

About the documentation/articles you contribute
-----------------------------------------------

Note the following only applies to documentation/articles meant to be published at the PrimeReact website.

  - All documentation artifacts, including articles, must be written **in correct English**.
  - Your name and email will be displayed as *"author"* of any documentation artifacts you create.
  - Topic and text structure must be first discussed and agreed upon with the project members.
  - Project members may edit and make small changes to your texts --of which you will be informed-- before 
    publishing them.
  - Format and visual styles must adhere to the PrimeReact website standards, of which you will be informed
    by the project members.



Pay special attention to this
-----------------------------

All PrimeReact software is distributed under the **MIT** open source license, and your contributions
will be licensed in the same way.

If you work for a company which, by the way or place in which your code was written, by your contract terms 
or by the laws in your country, could claim any rights (including but not limited to intellectual or industrial 
property) over your contributed code, you will have to send the project members (either by email from your 
authorised superiors or by signed fax), a statement indicating that your company agrees with the terms 
explained in this page, and that it both authorises your contribution to PrimeReact and states that will 
never claim any kind of rights over it.



PrimeReact Individual Contributor License Agreement
--------------------------------------------------

This contributor agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to the PrimeReact Project. 

This is a legally binding document, so please read it carefully before agreeing to it. The Agreement

        non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable license under the copyright covering the

UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.



### 6. Miscellaneous

    6.1 This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Spain excluding its
        conflicts of law provisions. Under certain circumstances, the governing law in this section might be
        superseded by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods ("UN
        Convention") and the parties intend to avoid the application of the UN Convention to this Agreement
        and, thus, exclude the application of the UN Convention in its entirety to this Agreement.
    6.2 This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between you and PrimeReact for your Contributions to
        PrimeReact and overrides all other agreements or understandings.
    6.3 If You or PrimeReact assign the rights or obligations received through this Agreement to a third party, 
        as a condition of the assignment, that third party must agree in writing to abide by all the rights and
        obligations in the Agreement.
    6.4 The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision of this
        Agreement in one situation shall not affect the right of a party to require such performance at any time
        in the future. A waiver of performance under a provision in one situation shall not be considered a
        waiver of the performance of the provision in the future or a waiver of the provision in its entirety.
    6.5 If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, such provision will be
        replaced to the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original
        provision and which is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall apply
        notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the
        maximum extent possible under law.
