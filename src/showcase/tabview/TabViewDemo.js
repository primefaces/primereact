            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
            <p>Tabview element consists of one or more TabPanel elements and can either be used as a Controlled or Uncontrolled component.</p>

            <h3>Controlled Component</h3>
            <p>In controlled mode, <i>activeIndex</i> and <i>onTabChange</i> properties need to be defined to control the state.</p>

<CodeHighlight className="language-jsx">
{`
<TabView activeIndex={this.state.activeIndex} onTabChange={(e) => this.setState({activeIndex: e.index})}>
    <TabPanel header="Header I">

    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel header="Header III">

    </TabPanel>
</TabView>

`}
</CodeHighlight>

            <h3>Uncontrolled</h3>
            <p>In uncontrolled mode, no additional properties are required. Initial active tab can be provided using the <i>activeIndex</i> property in uncontrolled mode however it is evaluated at initial rendering and ignored in further updates. If you programmatically
                need to update the active tab, prefer to use the component as controlled.</p>
